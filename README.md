# Companion AI

## Overview

**Companion AI** is a browser-based AI companion designed to help users improve **how they sound**, not **what they say**.

Instead of evaluating content or correctness, the system focuses purely on **delivery-level speaking habits**, helping users build confidence through awareness rather than judgment.

## What Companion AI Listens To

Companion AI analyzes a short mock interview response and reflects real audio signals such as:

- **Speaking pace**
- **Pauses and hesitation**
- **Filler word usage**
- **Sentence restarts**
- **Confidence drop zones**

---

## What Makes It Different

- ❌ No scoring  
- ❌ No ranking  
- ❌ No judgment  

Companion AI does **not** label answers as good or bad.

Instead, it calmly reflects observable speaking patterns, allowing users to notice habits on their own and improve gradually.

---

## Philosophy

The system acts as a **persistent companion**, not a one-time evaluator.

By staying present across practice sessions, Companion AI encourages:

- Self-awareness over performance pressure  
- Reflection over evaluation  
- Confidence through consistency  

---

## Goal

To help users sound clearer, steadier, and more confident —  
**without anxiety, comparison, or artificial judgment.**
